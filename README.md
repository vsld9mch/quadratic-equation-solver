Quadratic Equation SolverProject GoalThe primary objective of this project is to develop a program that calculates the roots of a quadratic equation in the form $ax^{2}+bx+c=0$. It is designed to handle both quadratic and linear scenarios, ensuring accurate mathematical analysis for various input parameters.+1FeaturesSupport for Real Numbers: The program is built to accept and process real numbers for all coefficients.Automatic Equation Detection: It checks if the provided coefficients form a quadratic equation. If the leading coefficient $a$ is zero, the program automatically solves it as a linear equation.+1Discriminant Analysis: The program calculates the discriminant ($\Delta$) to determine if the equation has 0, 1, or 2 real roots.Batch Processing: Each program execution allows the user to solve exactly 3 equations in a sequence using a loop.+1Specific Variable Naming: In accordance with technical requirements, all internal variables are prefixed with the author's initials (e.g., vdi_a, vdi_b).Technical StackLanguage: C#Framework: .NET 6.0 Project Type: Console Application How to RunPrerequisitesEnsure you have the .NET 6.0 SDK installed on your system.
